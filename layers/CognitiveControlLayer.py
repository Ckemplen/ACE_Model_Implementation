    While the executive function layer issues overall directives and project plans while the cognitive control layer
    has to do with task selection and task switching. This layer judges which task to take next, when that task is
    complete, and when it makes sense to switch tasks. This layer includes concepts such as frustration and cognitive
    damping. Frustration is a signal that keeps track of the ratio of successes to failures, so that the agent knows
    when it should try something else. Cognitive damping is basically a process of internal debate.
