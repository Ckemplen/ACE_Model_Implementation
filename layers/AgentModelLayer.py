    """
    The agent model layer keeps track of the agent state, capabilities, and limitations. This can be thought of
    similar to the "ego" - what the agents knows and believes about itself. To risk further anthropomorphizing this
    layer, this is the layer that confers functional sentience, that is to say that it contains and updates
    self-referential information about the operational conditions and capabilities of the agent. What am I? What can
    I do? How do I work? How can I change myself?

    Key Responsibilites:
    - Operational state of agent
    - Agentic capabilities and limitations
    - "Ego" and "sentience"
    - Internal configuration (models, training, learning, etc)
