### Core functionality for architecture ###
Refine the Cognitive Layer Base Class:

* Ensure the basic functionalities and structure of the CognitiveLayer base class align with the desired functionalities of all the layers.
* Define clear interfaces for communication between layers.

Implement Specific Layer Classes:

* Develop the specific functionalities of each cognitive layer (AspirationalLayer, GlobalStrategyLayer, AgentModelLayer, ExecutiveFunctionLayer, CognitiveControlLayer, and TaskProsecutionLayer).
* For each layer, implement the process_input, execute, and other necessary methods.

Develop the built-in Capability Classes:

* Flesh out the EthicalDecisionMakingCapability class with real decision-making logic.
* Add more capabilities as required by the different layers, and ensure they adhere to the Capability class structure.

Develop the built-in Resource Classes:

* Develop the CurrencyResource and SemanticMemoryResource classes with their specific functionalities.
* Add more resources as required by the different layers, and ensure they adhere to the Resource class structure.

Develop the built-in Product classes:

* Flesh out the various project initiation product classes with their requirements and formats
* Add new built in products as part of thinking through new use cases / test cases

Implement User Interaction Functionality:

* Develop a system for estimating user interaction time and creating a user interaction plan.
* Implement a user interface for interaction with the ACE model. This could be a CLI (command line interface) in the beginning and later develop into a GUI or a web-based interface.

Implement Multitasking and Asynchronous Operations:

* Develop a system to allow the ACE model to work on other tasks while waiting for user input. This could involve adding support for asynchronous operations or using a concurrency model like threading or multiprocessing.

Testing:

* Write unit tests for each class and method to ensure they work as expected.
* Perform integration testing to ensure the different components of the ACE model work together correctly.

Documentation:

* Document each class, method, and module with docstrings and comments.
* Write a user manual or guide for using the ACE model.

### GUI and UX ###
Design the Interface:

* Sketch out a design for the interface, keeping user experience principles in mind. It should be intuitive and easy to navigate. This step may involve creating wireframes or mockups of the interface. 

Implement the Interface:

* Choose a suitable library or framework for GUI development in Python. Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivy are popular choices, but the best one for you will depend on your specific needs.
Develop the basic structure of the interface, such as windows, menus, buttons, and text fields.

Connect the Interface to the ACE Model:

* Implement functionality to allow the user to input data through the GUI, and for the GUI to display output from the ACE model.
Ensure the GUI updates in response to changes in the ACE model (e.g., progress updates).

Test the Interface:

* Perform usability testing to ensure the interface is easy to use and intuitive. This may involve user testing, where you observe people using the interface and gather feedback on their experience.
Conduct functional testing to make sure all elements of the GUI are working correctly.

Refine the Interface:

* Based on feedback and testing, refine and improve the interface. This might involve making changes to the layout, adding new features, or improving existing ones.
